Elasticsearch Rolling Restart
=============================

This role can be used to perform a [rolling restart](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/rolling-upgrades.html) of an Elasticsearch cluster. All cluster hosts will be restarted one after the other with appropriate wait times in between for the cluster to return to green state.

Requirements
------------

A working Elasticsearch cluster with nodes listening at least on localhost is necessary for this role to be able to work.

Role Variables
--------------

**perform_flush**

Default: true
Should a [synced flush](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-synced-flush.html) be performed before initiating the cluster restart? This can be useful to speed up recovery times down during the restart, but will only work cleanly if you can stop any indexing activity in the cluster.


**ignore_failed_flush**

Default: false
Only relevant if _perform_flush_ is enabled. If this is set to _true_ the role will continue with the restart even if the synced flush call failed on a few shards.

**elastisearch_port**

Default: 9200
The port that should be used to communicate with Elasticsearch. If you have different ports per host override this in the host_vars as necessary.

Dependencies
------------

none

Example Playbook
----------------

The following example playbook would apply the role to all hosts of the group elasticsearch in your inventory using default values:

    - hosts: elasticsearch
      roles:
         - opencore.ansible_es_restart


If you can't stop indexing while you perform the restart you will want to ignore failed shards during the synced flush:

    - hosts: elasticsearch
      roles:
         - { role: opencore.ansible_es_restart, ignore_failed_flush: true }
